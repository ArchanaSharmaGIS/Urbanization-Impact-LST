## Project Overview
Urbanization has significant environmental impacts, one of which is the increase in Land Surface Temperature (LST). This project focuses on analyzing the changes in LST in Nagpur district, Maharashtra, over the past two decades, using satellite imagery from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, along with NDVI and LST indices. The analysis leverages Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to study the correlation between urban growth and temperature rise.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to examine the impact of urbanization on LST in Nagpur district by:
<br>
Analyzing NDVI and LST values over time.<br>
Correlating vegetation changes with temperature variation.<br>
Mapping LST variations across urban and rural areas.


## Data and Methods
### Data Sources
Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery for LST calculation.
Shapefiles and TIF files for spatial analysis.
### Methods Used
LST Calculation: Uses DN (Digital Numbers) to Radiance conversion and Brightness Temperature calculation.
NDVI Calculation: Utilizes Red and NIR bands to calculate vegetation index.
Regression Analysis: Compares LST values across different years.
GIS Mapping: Creates maps showing temperature variations.

## Result
This study provides insights into the effects of urbanization on LST in Nagpur over two decades. Below are some key findings:

### Key Findings
**NDVI vs. LST Analysis**: NDVI values have shown a decline in green vegetation, while LST has increased, correlating with the urban expansion in Nagpur.<br>
**Regression Analysis**: The correlation between NDVI and LST highlights the impact of vegetation loss on urban temperatures.
